['Title:Knowledge of Uncertain Worlds: Programming with Logical Constraints'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 23 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Programming with logic for sophisticated applications must deal with recursion and negation, which have created significant challenges in logic,leading to many different, conflicting semantics of rules. This paper describes a unified language, DA logic, for design and analysis logic, based on the unifying founded semantics and constraint semantics, that support the power and ease of programming with different intended semantics. The key idea is to provide meta constraints, support the use of uncertain information in the form of either undefined values or possible combinations of values, and promote the use of knowledge units that can be instantiated by any new predicates,including predicates with additional arguments.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10346





['Title: Faster and Safer Training by Embedding High-Level Knowledge into Deep Reinforcement Learning'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 22 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Deep reinforcement learning has been successfully used in many dynamic decision making domains, especially those with very large state spaces. However, it is also well-known that deep reinforcement learning can be very slow and resource intensive. The resulting system is often brittle and difficult to explain. In this paper, we attempt to address some of these problems by proposing a framework of Rule-interposing Learning (RIL) that embeds high level rules into the deep reinforcement learning. With some good rules, this framework not only can accelerate the learning process, but also keep it away from catastrophic explorations, thus making the system relatively stable even during the very early stage of training. Moreover, given the rules are high level and easy to interpret, they can be easily maintained, updated and shared with other similar tasks.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09986

['Title: Phase Transition Behavior of Cardinality and XOR Constraints'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 22 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  The runtime performance of modern SAT solvers is deeply connected to the phase transition behaviour of CNF formulas. While CNF solving has witnessed significant runtime improvement over the past two decades, the same does not hold for several other classes such as the conjunction of cardinality and XOR constraints, denoted as CARD-XOR formulas. The problem of determining the satisfiability of CARD-XOR formulas is a fundamental problem with a wide variety of applications ranging from discrete integration in the field of artificial intelligence to maximum likelihood decoding in coding theory. The runtime behavior of random CARD-XOR formulas is unexplored in prior work. In this paper, we present the first rigorous empirical study to characterize the runtime behavior of 1-CARD-XOR formulas. We show empirical evidence of a surprising phase-transition that follows a non-linear trade off between CARD and XOR constraints.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09755



['Title:Intelligence via ultrafilters: structural properties of some intelligence comparators of deterministic Legg-Hutter agents'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 22 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Legg and Hutter, as well as subsequent authors, considered intelligent agents through the lens of interaction with reward-giving environments, attempting to assign numeric intelligence measures to such agents, with the guiding principle that a more intelligent agent should gain higher rewards from environments in some aggregate sense. In this paper, we consider a related question: rather than measure numeric intelligence of one Legg- Hutter agent, how can we compare the relative intelligence of two Legg-Hutter agents? We propose an elegant answer based on the following insight: we can view Legg-Hutter agents as candidates in an election, whose voters are environments, letting each environment vote (via its rewards) which agent (if either) is more intelligent. This leads to an abstract family of comparators simple enough that we can provesome structural theorems about them. It is an open question whether these structural theorems apply to more practical intelligence measures.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09721

['Title:Language-guided Semantic Mapping and Mobile Manipulation in Partially Observable Environments'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 22 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Recent advances in data-driven models for grounded language understandinghave enabled robots to interpret increasingly complex instructions. Twofundamental limitations of these methods are that most require a full model ofthe environment to be known a priori, and they attempt to reason over a worldrepresentation that is flat and unnecessarily detailed, which limitsscalability. Recent semantic mapping methods address partial observability byexploiting language as a sensor to infer a distribution over topological,metric and semantic properties of the environment. However, maintaining adistribution over highly detailed maps that can support grounding of diverseinstructions is computationally expensive and hinders real-time human-robotcollaboration. We propose a novel framework that learns to adapt perceptionaccording to the task in order to maintain compact distributions over semanticmaps.

['Title:A simple and effective hybrid genetic search for the job sequencing and tool switching problem'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 10 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  The job sequencing and tool switching problem (SSP) has been extensivelystudied in the field of operations research, due to its practical relevance andmethodological interest. Given a machine that can load a limited amount oftools simultaneously and a number of jobs that require a subset of theavailable tools, the SSP seeks a job sequence that minimizes the number of toolswitches in the machine. To solve this problem, we propose a simple andefficient hybrid genetic search based on a generic solution representation, atailored decoding operator, efficient local searches and diversity managementtechniques. To guide the search, we introduce a secondary objective designed tobreak ties. These techniques allow to explore structurally different solutionsand escape local optima.

['Title:Learning Resilient Behaviors for Navigation Under Uncertainty Environments'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 22 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Deep reinforcement learning has great potential to acquire complex, adaptivebehaviors for autonomous agents automatically. However, the underlying neuralnetwork polices have not been widely deployed in real-world applications,especially in these safety-critical tasks (e.g., autonomous driving). One ofthe reasons is that the learned policy cannot perform flexible and resilientbehaviors as traditional methods to adapt to diverse environments. In this paper, we consider the problem that a mobile robot learns adaptive and resilient behaviors for navigating in unseen uncertain environments whileavoiding collisions. We present a novel approach for uncertainty-awarenavigation by introducing an uncertainty-aware predictor to model theenvironmental uncertainty, and we propose a novel uncertainty-aware navigationnetwork to learn resilient behaviors in the prior unknown environments. Totrain the proposed uncertainty-aware network more stably and efficiently, wepresent the temperature decay training paradigm, which balances exploration andexploitation during the training process. Our experimental evaluationdemonstrates that our approach can learn resilient behaviors in diverseenvironments and generate adaptive trajectories according to environmentaluncertainties.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09998

The survey measured opinions about the likelihood future technologywould fully replace physicians in performing ten key psychiatric tasks. Thisstudy involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written response to threeopen-ended questions in the survey.

Overwhelmingly, psychiatristswere skeptical that technology could fully replace human empathy. Manypredicted that 'man and machine' would increasingly collaborate in undertakingclinical decisions, with mixed opinions about the benefits and harms of such anarrangement.

['Title:Embedded Bayesian Network Classifiers'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 22 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Low-dimensional probability models for local distribution functions in aBayesian network include decision trees, decision graphs, and causalindependence models. We describe a new probability model for discrete Bayesiannetworks, which we call an embedded Bayesian network classifier or EBNC.

We show that an EBNC is a special case of a softmaxpolynomial regression model. Also, we show how to identify a non-redundant setof parameters for an EBNC, and describe an asymptotic approximation forlearning the structure of Bayesian networks that contain EBNCs.

['Title:ALGAMES: A Fast Solver for Constrained Dynamic Games'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 22 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Dynamic games are an effective paradigm for dealing with the control ofmultiple interacting actors. Current algorithms for solving these problemseither rely on Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) methods, dynamic programming (DP),differential dynamic programming (DDP), or an iterative best response approach(IBR). The first two approaches have strong theoretical guarantees; howeverthey becomes intractable in high-dimensional real-world applications. The thirdapproach is grounded in the success of iLQR.

The reason why the principle of absolute instead of net utility doesnot work is because it is a first order approximation of some unknown utilityfunction. Because the net utility concept is able to explain both behavioraleconomics and the St Petersburg paradox it is deemed a universal approach tohandling utility.

['Title:Toward automatic comparison of visualization techniques: Application to graph visualization'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 21 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Many end-user evaluations of data visualization techniques have been runduring the last decades. Their results are cornerstones to build efficientvisualization systems. However, designing an evaluation is always complex andtime-consuming and may end in a lack of statistical evidence. The raising ofmodern efficient computer vision techniques may help visualization researchersto adjust their evaluation hypothesis and thus reduces the risk of failure. Inthis paper, we present a methodology that uses such computer vision techniquesto automatically compare the efficiency of several visualization techniques.The basis of our methodology is to generate a set of images for each comparedvisualization technique from a common dataset and to train machine learningmodels (one for each set and visualization technique) to solve a given task.Our assumption is that the performance of each model allows to compare theefficiencies of the corresponding visualization techniques; as current machinelearning models are not capable enough to reflect human capabilities, includingtheir imperfections, such results should be interpreted with caution. However,we argue that using machine learning-based evaluation as a pre-process ofstandard user evaluations should help researchers to perform a more exhaustivestudy of the design space and thus should improve the final user evaluation byproviding better test cases. To show that our methodology can reproduce, up toa certain level, results of user evaluations, we applied it to compare twomainstream graph visualization techniques: node-link (NL) and adjacency-matrix(MD) diagrams. We partially reproduced a user evaluation from Ghoniem et al.using two well-known deep convolutional neural networks as machinelearning-based systems.

['Title:Redistribution Mechanism Design on Networks'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 21 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Redistribution mechanisms have been proposed for more efficient resourceallocation but not for profit. We consider redistribution mechanism design forthe first time in a setting where participants are connected and the resourceowner is only aware of her neighbours. In this setting, to make the resourceallocation more efficient, the resource owner has to inform the others who arenot her neighbours, but her neighbours do not want more participants to competewith them. Hence, the goal is to design a redistribution mechanism such thatparticipants are incentivized to invite more participants and the resourceowner does not earn or lose much money from the allocation. We first show thatexisting redistribution mechanisms cannot be directly applied in the networksetting to achieve the goal.

Solving DMOPs impliesthat the Pareto Optimal Set (POS) at different moments can be accurately found,and this is a very difficult job due to the dynamics of the optimizationproblems. The POS that have been obtained in the past can help us to find thePOS of the next time more quickly and accurately. Therefore, in this paper wepresent a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based Dynamic Multi-ObjectiveEvolutionary optimization Algorithm, called SVM-DMOEA. The algorithm uses thePOS that has been obtained to train a SVM and then take the trained SVM toclassify the solutions of the dynamic optimization problem at the next moment,and thus it is able to generate an initial population which consists ofdifferent individuals recognized by the trained SVM.

['Title:Multi-agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Termination'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 21 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  In a multi-agent system, an agent's optimal policy will typically depend onthe policies chosen by others. Therefore, a key issue in multi-agent systemsresearch is that of predicting the behaviours of others, and respondingpromptly to changes in such behaviours. One obvious possibility is for eachagent to broadcast their current intention, for example, the currently executedoption in a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. However, thisapproach results in inflexibility of agents if options have an extendedduration and are dynamic. While adjusting the executed option at each stepimproves flexibility from a single-agent perspective, frequent changes inoptions can induce inconsistency between an agent's actual behaviour and itsbroadcast intention. In order to balance flexibility and predictability, wepropose a dynamic termination Bellman equation that allows the agents toflexibly terminate their options. We evaluate our model empirically on a set ofmulti-agent pursuit and taxi tasks, and show that our agents learn to adaptflexibly across scenarios that require different termination behaviours.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09508
['Title:Policy Optimization for $\\mathcal{H}_2$ Linear Control with $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ Robustness Guarantee: Implicit Regularization and Global Convergence'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 21 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Policy optimization (PO) is a key ingredient for reinforcement learning (RL).For control design, certain constraints are usually enforced on the policies tooptimize, accounting for either the stability, robustness, or safety concernson the system. Hence, PO is by nature a constrained (nonconvex) optimization inmost cases, whose global convergence is challenging to analyze in general. Moreimportantly, some constraints that are safety-critical, e.g., the$\mathcal{H}_\infty$-norm constraint that guarantees the system robustness, aredifficult to enforce as the PO methods proceed. Recently, policy gradientmethods have been shown to converge to the global optimum of linear quadraticregulator (LQR), a classical optimal control problem, withoutregularizing/projecting the control iterates onto the stabilizing set (Fazel etal., 2018), its (implicit) feasible set. This striking result is built upon thecoercive property of the cost, ensuring that the iterates remain feasible asthe cost decreases. In this paper, we study the convergence theory of PO for$\mathcal{H}_2$ linear control with $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-norm robustnessguarantee. One significant new feature of this problem is the lack ofcoercivity, i.e., the cost may have finite value around the feasible setboundary, breaking the existing analyses for LQR. Interestingly, we show thattwo PO methods enjoy the implicit regularization property, i.e., the iteratespreserve the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ robustness constraint as if they areregularized by the algorithms. Furthermore, convergence to the globally optimalpolicies with globally sublinear and locally (super-)linear rates are providedunder certain conditions, despite the nonconvexity of the problem. To the bestof our knowledge, our work offers the first results on the implicitregularization property and global convergence of PO methods forrobust/risk-sensitive control.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09496

['Title:Making Bayesian Predictive Models Interpretable: A Decision Theoretic Approach'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 21 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  A salient approach to interpretable machine learning is to restrict modelingto simple and hence understandable models. In the Bayesian framework, this canbe pursued by restricting the model structure and prior to favor interpretablemodels. Fundamentally, however, interpretability is about users' preferences,not the data generation mechanism: it is more natural to formulateinterpretability as a utility function. In this work, we propose aninterpretability utility, which explicates the trade-off between explanationfidelity and interpretability in the Bayesian framework. The method consists oftwo steps. First, a reference model, possibly a black-box Bayesian predictivemodel compromising no accuracy, is constructed and fitted to the training data.Second, a proxy model from an interpretable model family that best mimics thepredictive behaviour of the reference model is found by optimizing theinterpretability utility function. The approach is model agnostic - neither theinterpretable model nor the reference model are restricted to be from a certainclass of models - and the optimization problem can be solved using standardtools in the chosen model family. Through experiments on real-word data setsusing decision trees as interpretable models and Bayesian additive regressionmodels as reference models, we show that for the same level ofinterpretability, our approach generates more accurate models than the earlieralternative of restricting the prior. We also propose a systematic way tomeasure stabilities of interpretabile models constructed by differentinterpretability approaches and show that our proposed approach generates morestable models.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09358

['Title:Trends in the optimal location and sizing of electrical units in smart grids using meta-heuristic algorithms'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 16 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  The development of smart grids has effectively transformed the traditionalgrid system. This promises numerous advantages for economic values andautonomous control of energy sources. In smart grids development, there arevarious objectives such as voltage stability, minimized power loss, minimizedeconomic cost and voltage profile improvement. Thus, researchers haveinvestigated several approaches based on meta-heuristic optimization algorithmsfor the optimal location and sizing of electrical units in a distributionsystem. Meta-heuristic algorithms have been applied to solve different problemsin power systems and they have been successfully used in distribution systems.This paper presents a comprehensive review on existing methods for the optimallocation and sizing of electrical units in distribution networks whileconsidering the improvement of major objective functions. Techniques such asvoltage stability index, power loss index, and loss sensitivity factors havebeen implemented alongside the meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to reducethe search space of solutions for objective functions. However, thesetechniques can cause a loss of optimality. Another perceived problem is theinappropriate handling of multiple objectives, which can also affect theoptimality of results. Hence, a recent method such as Pareto fronts generationhas been developed to produce non-dominating solutions. This review shows aneed for more research on (i) the effective handling of multiple objectivefunctions, (ii) more efficient meta-heuristic optimization algorithms and/or(iii) better supporting techniques.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09312
['Title:On Semi-Supervised Multiple Representation Behavior Learning'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 21 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  We propose a novel paradigm of semi-supervised learning (SSL)--thesemi-supervised multiple representation behavior learning (SSMRBL). SSMRBL aimsto tackle the difficulty of learning a grammar for natural language parsingwhere the data are natural language texts and the 'labels' for marking data areparsing trees and/or grammar rule pieces. We call such 'labels' as compoundstructured labels which require a hard work for training. SSMRBL is anincremental learning process that can learn more than one representation, whichis an appropriate solution for dealing with the scarce of labeled training datain the age of big data and with the heavy workload of learning compoundstructured labels. We also present a typical example of SSMRBL, regardingbehavior learning in form of a grammatical approach towards domain-basedmultiple text summarization (DBMTS). DBMTS works under the framework ofrhetorical structure theory (RST). SSMRBL includes two representations: textembedding (for representing information contained in the texts) and grammarmodel (for representing parsing as a behavior). The first representation waslearned as embedded digital vectors called impacts in a low dimensional space.The grammar model was learned in an iterative way. Then an automaticdomain-oriented multi-text summarization approach was proposed based on the tworepresentations discussed above. Experimental results on large-scale Chinesedataset SogouCA indicate that the proposed method brings a good performanceeven if only few labeled texts are used for training with respect to ourdefined automated metrics.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09292

This algorithm is based on a mirror ascentalgorithm, which suits with the framework of no-regret online learning, and onthe augmented Lagrangian method. The decentralization aspect of the algorithmcorresponds to the aspects that the iterate of each player requires the localinformation about how she contributes to the coupling constraints and the pricevector broadcasted by a central coordinator. So each player needs not knowabout the population action. Moreover, no specific control by the centralprimary coordinator is required.

['Title:Multi-Band Multi-Resolution Fully Convolutional Neural Networks for Singing Voice Separation'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 21 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Deep neural networks with convolutional layers usually process the entirespectrogram of an audio signal with the same time-frequency resolutions, numberof filters, and dimensionality reduction scale. According to the constant-Qtransform, good features can be extracted from audio signals if the lowfrequency bands are processed with high frequency resolution filters and thehigh frequency bands with high time resolution filters. In the spectrogram of amixture of singing voices and music signals, there is usually more informationabout the voice in the low frequency bands than the high frequency bands.

['Title:Constructing Artificial Data for Fine-tuning for Low-Resource Biomedical Text Tagging with Applications in PICO Annotation'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 21 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Biomedical text tagging systems are plagued by the dearth of labeled trainingdata. There have been recent attempts at using pre-trained encoders to dealwith this issue. Pre-trained encoder provides representation of the input textwhich is then fed to task-specific layers for classification. The entirenetwork is fine-tuned on the labeled data from the target task. Unfortunately,a low-resource biomedical task often has too few labeled instances forsatisfactory fine-tuning. Also, if the label space is large, it contains few orno labeled instances for majority of the labels. Most biomedical taggingsystems treat labels as indexes, ignoring the fact that these labels are oftenconcepts expressed in natural language e.g. `Appearance of lesion on brainimaging'. To address these issues, we propose constructing extra labeledinstances using label-text (i.e. label's name) as input for the correspondinglabel-index (i.e. label's index). In fact, we propose a number of strategiesfor manufacturing multiple artificial labeled instances from a single label.The network is then fine-tuned on a combination of real and these newlyconstructed artificial labeled instances. We evaluate the proposed approach onan important low-resource biomedical task called \textit{PICO annotation},which requires tagging raw text describing clinical trials with labelscorresponding to different aspects of the trial i.e. PICO (Population,Intervention/Control, Outcome) characteristics of the trial. Our empiricalresults show that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-artperformance for PICO annotation with very significant improvements overcompetitive baselines.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09255
['Title:Regularization Matters in Policy Optimization'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 21 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) has been receiving increasingly moreattention thanks to its encouraging performance on a variety of control tasks.Yet, conventional regularization techniques in training neural networks (e.g.,$L_2$ regularization, dropout) have been largely ignored in RL methods,possibly because agents are typically trained and evaluated in the sameenvironment. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study ofregularization techniques with multiple policy optimization algorithms oncontinuous control tasks. Interestingly, we find conventional regularizationtechniques on the policy networks can often bring large improvement on the taskperformance, and the improvement is typically more significant when the task ismore difficult. We also compare with the widely used entropy regularization andfind $L_2$ regularization is generally better. Our findings are furtherconfirmed to be robust against the choice of training hyperparameters. We alsostudy the effects of regularizing different components and find that onlyregularizing the policy network is typically enough. We hope our study providesguidance for future practices in regularizing policy optimization algorithms.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09191

In this workshop, I share twoprojects as case studies in which people engage with ML in much morecomplicated and nuanced ways than the technical HCML work might assume. Thefirst case study describes how cardiology teams in three hospitals used aclinical decision-support system that helps them decide whether and when toimplant an artificial heart to a heart failure patient. I demonstrate thatphysicians cannot draw on their decision-making experience by seeing onlypatient data on paper. They are also confused by some fundamental premises uponwhich ML operates. For example, physicians asked: Are ML predictions made basedon clinicians' best efforts? Is it ethical to make decisions based on previouspatients' collective outcomes? In the second case study, my collaborators and Idesigned an intelligent text editor, with the goal of improving authors'writing experience with NLP (Natural Language Processing) technologies. Weprototyped a number of generative functionalities where the system providesphrase-or-sentence-level writing suggestions upon user request. When writingwith the prototype, however, authors shared that they need to ""see where thesentence is going two paragraphs later"" in order to decide whether thesuggestion aligns with their writing; Some even considered adopting machinesuggestions as plagiarism, therefore ""is simply wrong"".By sharing these unexpected and intriguing responses from these real-world MLusers, I hope to start a discussion about such previously-unknown complexitiesand nuances of -- as the workshop proposal states -- ""putting ML at the serviceof people in a way that is accessible, useful, and trustworthy to all"".",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09137
['Title:Unsupervised Out-of-Distribution Detection with Batch Normalization'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 21 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Likelihood from a generative model is a natural statistic for detectingout-of-distribution (OoD) samples. However, generative models have been shownto assign higher likelihood to OoD samples compared to ones from the trainingdistribution, preventing simple threshold-based detection rules. We demonstratethat OoD detection fails even when using more sophisticated statistics based onthe likelihoods of individual samples. To address these issues, we propose anew method that leverages batch normalization. We argue that batchnormalization for generative models challenges the traditional i.i.d. dataassumption and changes the corresponding maximum likelihood objective. Based onthis insight, we propose to exploit in-batch dependencies for OoD detection.Empirical results suggest that this leads to more robust detection forhigh-dimensional images.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09115

Using Local Knowledge Graph Construction to Scale Seq2Seq Models to Multi-Document Inputs

Query-based open-domain NLP tasks require information synthesis from long and diverse web results. Current approaches extractively select portions of web text as input to Sequence-to-Sequence models using methods such as TF-IDF ranking. We propose constructing a local graph structured knowledge base for each query, which compresses the web search information and reduces redundancy. We show that by linearizing the graph into a structured input sequence, models can encode the graph representations within a standard Sequence-to-Sequence setting. For two generative tasks with very long text input, long-form question answering and multi-document summarization, feeding graph representations as input can achieve better performance than using retrieved text portions.





['Title:Towards Quantifying Intrinsic Generalization of Deep ReLU Networks'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 18 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Understanding the underlying mechanisms that enable the empirical successesof deep neural networks is essential for further improving their performanceand explaining such networks. Towards this goal, a specific question is how to explain the ""surprising"" behavior of the same over-parametrized deep neuralnetworks that can generalize well on real datasets and at the same time""memorize"" training samples when the labels are randomized. In this paper, wedemonstrate that deep ReLU networks generalize from training samples to newpoints via piece-wise linear interpolation. We provide a quantified analysis onthe generalization ability of a deep ReLU network: Given a fixed point$\mathbf{x}$ and a fixed direction in the input space $\mathcal{S}$, there isalways a segment such that any point on the segment will be classified the sameas the fixed point $\mathbf{x}$. We call this segment the $generalization \interval$. We show that the generalization intervals of a ReLU network behavesimilarly along pairwise directions between samples of the same label in bothreal and random cases on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. This result suggeststhat the same interpolation mechanism is used in both cases. Additionally, fordatasets using real labels, such networks provide a good approximation of theunderlying manifold in the data, where the changes are much smaller alongtangent directions than along normal directions. On the other hand, however,for datasets with random labels, generalization intervals along mid-lines oftriangles with the same label are much smaller than those on the datasets withreal labels, suggesting different behaviors along other directions. Oursystematic experiments demonstrate for the first time that such deep neuralnetworks generalize through the same interpolation and explain the differencesbetween their performance on datasets with real and random labels.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08581

['Title:Towards Learning Cross-Modal Perception-Trace Models'],KG,(Submitted on 18 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Representation learning is a key element of state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. It enables to transform raw data into structured vector space embeddings. Such embeddings are able to capture the distributional semantics of their context, e.g. by word windows on natural language sentences, graph walks on knowledge graphs or convolutions on images. So far, this context is manually defined, resulting in heuristics which are solely optimized for computational performance on certain tasks like link-prediction. However, such heuristic models of context are fundamentally different to how humans capture information. For instance, when reading a multi-modal webpage (i) humans do not perceive all parts of a document equally: Some words and parts of images are skipped, others are revisited several times which makes the perception trace highly non-sequential; (ii) humans construct meaning from a document's content by shifting their attention between text and image, among other things, guided by layout and design elements. In this paper we empirically investigate the difference between human perception and context heuristics of basic embedding models. We conduct eye tracking experiments to capture the underlying characteristics of human perception of media documents containing a mixture of text and images. Based on that, we devise a prototypical computational perception-trace model, called CMPM. We evaluate empirically how CMPM can improve a basic skip-gram embedding approach. Our results suggest, that even with a basic human-inspired computational perception model, there is a huge potential for improving embeddings since such a model does inherently capture multiple modalities, as well as layout and design elements.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08549







['Title:A flexible integer linear programming formulation for scheduling clinician on-call service in hospitals'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 18 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Scheduling of personnel in a hospital environment is vital to improving theservice provided to patients and balancing the workload assigned to clinicians.Many approaches have been tried and successfully applied to generate efficientschedules in such settings. However, due to the computational complexity of thescheduling problem in general, most approaches resort to heuristics to find anon-optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time. We designed an integerlinear programming formulation to find an optimal schedule in a clinicaldivision of a hospital. Our formulation mitigates issues related tocomputational complexity by minimizing the set of constraints, yet retainssufficient flexibility so that it can be adapted to a variety of clinicaldivisions.We then conducted a case study for our approach using data from theInfectious Diseases division at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Canada. Weanalyzed and compared the results of our approach to manually-created schedulesat the hospital, and found improved adherence to departmental constraints andclinician preferences. We used simulated data to examine the sensitivity of theruntime of our linear program for various parameters and observed reassuringresults, signifying the practicality and generalizability of our approach indifferent real-world scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08526
['Title:Reflecting After Learning for Understanding'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 18 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Today, image classification is a common way for systems to process visualcontent. Although neural network approaches to classification have seen greatprogress in reducing error rates, it is not clear what this means for acognitive system that needs to make sense of the multiple and competingpredictions from its own classifiers. As a step to address this, we present anovel framework that uses meta-reasoning and meta-operations to unifypredictions into abstractions, properties, or relationships. Using theframework on images from ImageNet, we demonstrate systems that unify 41% to 46%of predictions in general and unify 67% to 75% of predictions when the systemscan explain their conceptual differences. We also demonstrate a system in ""thewild"" by feeding live video images through it and show it unifying 51% ofpredictions in general and 69% of predictions when their differences can beexplained conceptually by the system. In a survey given to 24 participants, wefound that 87% of the unified predictions describe their corresponding images.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08243
['Title:Planning for Goal-Oriented Dialogue Systems'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 17 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Generating complex multi-turn goal-oriented dialogue agents is a difficultproblem that has seen a considerable focus from many leaders in the techindustry, including IBM, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. This is in large partdue to the rapidly growing market demand for dialogue agents capable ofgoal-oriented behaviour. Due to the business process nature of theseconversations, end-to-end machine learning systems are generally not a viableoption, as the generated dialogue agents must be deployable and verifiable onbehalf of the businesses authoring them.In this work, we propose a paradigm shift in the creation of goal-orientedcomplex dialogue systems that dramatically eliminates the need for a designerto manually specify a dialogue tree, which nearly all current systems have toresort to when the interaction pattern falls outside standard patterns such asslot filling. We propose a declarative representation of the dialogue agent tobe processed by state-of-the-art planning technology. Our proposed approachcovers all aspects of the process; from model solicitation to the execution ofthe generated plans/dialogue agents. Along the way, we introduce novel planningencodings for declarative dialogue synthesis, a variety of interfaces forworking with the specification as a dialogue architect, and a robust executorfor generalized contingent plans. We have created prototype implementations ofall components, and in this paper, we further demonstrate the resulting systemempirically.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08137

['Title:Towards Computing Inferences from English News Headlines'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 18 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Newspapers are a popular form of written discourse, read by many people,thanks to the novelty of the information provided by the news content in it. Aheadline is the most widely read part of any newspaper due to its appearance ina bigger font and sometimes in colour print. In this paper, we suggest andimplement a method for computing inferences from English news headlines,excluding the information from the context in which the headlines appear. Thismethod attempts to generate the possible assumptions a reader formulates inmind upon reading a fresh headline. The generated inferences could be usefulfor assessing the impact of the news headline on readers including children.The understandability of the current state of social affairs depends greatly onthe assimilation of the headlines. As the inferences that are independent ofthe context depend mainly on the syntax of the headline, dependency trees ofheadlines are used in this approach, to find the syntactical structure of theheadlines and to compute inferences out of them.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08294
['Title:Follow Alice into the Rabbit Hole: Giving Dialogue Agents Understanding of Human Level Attributes'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 18 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  For conversational AI and virtual assistants to communicate with humans in arealistic way, they must exhibit human characteristics such as expression ofemotion and personality. Current attempts toward constructing human-likedialogue agents have presented significant difficulties. We propose Human LevelAttributes (HLAs) based on tropes as the basis of a method for learningdialogue agents that can imitate the personalities of fictional characters.Tropes are characteristics of fictional personalities that are observedrecurrently and determined by viewers' impressions. By combining detailed HLAdata with dialogue data for specific characters, we present a dataset thatmodels character profiles and gives dialogue agents the ability to learncharacters' language styles through their HLAs. We then introduce athree-component system, ALOHA (which stands for Artificial Learning On HumanAttributes), that combines character space mapping, character communitydetection, and language style retrieval to build a character (or personality)specific language model. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that ALOHA,combined with our proposed dataset, can outperform baseline models atidentifying correct dialogue responses of any chosen target character, and isstable regardless of the character's identity, genre of the show, and contextof the dialogue.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08293
['Title:Unsupervised Context Rewriting for Open Domain Conversation'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 18 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Context modeling has a pivotal role in open domain conversation. Existingworks either use heuristic methods or jointly learn context modeling andresponse generation with an encoder-decoder framework. This paper proposes anexplicit context rewriting method, which rewrites the last utterance byconsidering context history. We leverage pseudo-parallel data and elaborate acontext rewriting network, which is built upon the CopyNet with thereinforcement learning method. The rewritten utterance is beneficial tocandidate retrieval, explainable context modeling, as well as enabling toemploy a single-turn framework to the multi-turn scenario. The empiricalresults show that our model outperforms baselines in terms of the rewritingquality, the multi-turn response generation, and the end-to-end retrieval-basedchatbots.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08282
['Title:RTFM: Generalising to Novel Environment Dynamics via Reading'],Artificial Intelligence ,(Submitted on 18 Oct 2019),"Abstract:  Obtaining policies that can generalise to new environments in reinforcementlearning is challenging. In this work, we demonstrate that languageunderstanding via a reading policy learner is a promising vehicle forgeneralisation to new environments. We propose a grounded policy learningproblem, Read to Fight Monsters (RTFM), in which the agent must jointly reasonover a language goal, relevant dynamics described in a document, andenvironment observations. We procedurally generate environment dynamics andcorresponding language descriptions of the dynamics, such that agents must readto understand new environment dynamics instead of memorising any particularinformation. In addition, we propose txt2$\pi$, a model that captures three-wayinteractions between the goal, document, and observations. On RTFM, txt2$\pi$generalises to new environments with dynamics not seen during training viareading. Furthermore, our model outperforms baselines such as FiLM andlanguage-conditioned CNNs on RTFM. Through curriculum learning, txt2$\pi$produces policies that excel on complex RTFM tasks requiring several reasoningand coreference steps.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08210
