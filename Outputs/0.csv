Learning a faceted customer segmentation for discovering new business opportunities at Intel,2019-11-27,"For sales and marketing organizations within large enterprises, identifyingand understanding new markets, customers and partners is a key challenge.Intel's Sales and Marketing Group (SMG) faces similar challenges while growingin new markets and domains and evolving its existing business. In today'scomplex technological and commercial landscape, there is need for intelligentautomation supporting a fine-grained understanding of businesses in order tohelp SMG sift through millions of companies across many geographies andlanguages and identify relevant directions. We present a system developed inour company that mines millions of public business web pages, and extracts afaceted customer representation. We focus on two key customer aspects that areessential for finding relevant opportunities: industry segments (ranging frombroad verticals such as healthcare, to more specific fields such as 'videoanalytics') and functional roles (e.g., 'manufacturer' or 'retail'). To addressthe challenge of labeled data collection, we enrich our data with externalinformation gleaned from Wikipedia, and develop a semi-supervised multi-label,multi-lingual deep learning model that parses customer website texts andclassifies them into their respective facets. Our system scans and indexescompanies as part of a large-scale knowledge graph that currently holds tens ofmillions of connected entities with thousands being fetched, enriched andconnected to the graph by the hour in real time, and also supports knowledgeand insight discovery. In experiments conducted in our company, we are able tosignificantly boost the performance of sales personnel in the task ofdiscovering new customers and commercial partnership opportunities.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00778
Knowledge Infused Learning (K-IL): Towards Deep Incorporation of Knowledge in Deep Learning,2019-12-01,"Learning the underlying patterns in the data goes beyond instance-basedgeneralization to some external knowledge represented in structured graphs ornetworks. Deep Learning (DL) has shown significant advances inprobabilistically learning latent patterns in the data using a multi-layerednetwork of computational nodes (i.e. neurons/hidden units). However, with thetremendous amount of training data, uncertainty in generalization ondomain-specific tasks, and delta improvement with an increase in complexity ofmodels seem to raise a concern on the features learned by the model. Asincorporation of domain specific knowledge will aid in supervising the learningof features for the model, infusion of knowledge from knowledge graphs withinhidden layers will further enhance the learning process. Although much workremains, we believe that KGs will play an increasing role in developing hybridneuro-symbolic intelligent systems (that is bottom up deep learning with topdown symbolic computing) as well as in building explainable AI systems forwhich KGs will provide a scaffolding for punctuating neural computing. In thisposition paper, we describe our motivation for such hybrid approach and aframework that combines knowledge graph and neural networks.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00512
Integrating Graph Contextualized Knowledge into Pre-trained Language Models,2019-11-30,"Complex node interactions are common in knowledge graphs, and theseinteractions also contain rich knowledge information. However, traditionalmethods usually treat a triple as a training unit during the knowledgerepresentation learning (KRL) procedure, neglecting contextualized informationof the nodes in knowledge graphs (KGs). We generalize the modeling object to avery general form, which theoretically supports any subgraph extracted from theknowledge graph, and these subgraphs are fed into a novel transformer-basedmodel to learn the knowledge embeddings. To broaden usage scenarios ofknowledge, pre-trained language models are utilized to build a model thatincorporates the learned knowledge representations. Experimental resultsdemonstrate that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on severalmedical NLP tasks, and improvement above TransE indicates that our KRL methodcaptures the graph contextualized information effectively.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00147
Product Knowledge Graph Embedding for E-commerce,2019-11-28,"In this paper, we propose a new product knowledge graph (PKG) embeddingapproach for learning the intrinsic product relations as product knowledge fore-commerce. We define the key entities and summarize the pivotal productrelations that are critical for general e-commerce applications includingmarketing, advertisement, search ranking and recommendation. We first provide acomprehensive comparison between PKG and ordinary knowledge graph (KG) and thenillustrate why KG embedding methods are not suitable for PKG learning. Weconstruct a self-attention-enhanced distributed representation learning modelfor learning PKG embeddings from raw customer activity data in an end-to-endfashion. We design an effective multi-task learning schema to fully leveragethe multi-modal e-commerce data. The Poincare embedding is also employed tohandle complex entity structures. We use a real-world dataset fromthis http URL to evaluate the performances on knowledge completion,search ranking and recommendation. The proposed approach compares favourably tobaselines in knowledge completion and downstream tasks.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12481
FCA2VEC: Embedding Techniques for Formal Concept Analysis,2019-11-26,"Embedding large and high dimensional data into low dimensional vector spacesis a necessary task to computationally cope with contemporary data sets.Superseding latent semantic analysis recent approaches like word2vec ornode2vec are well established tools in this realm. In the present paper we addto this line of research by introducing fca2vec, a family of embeddingtechniques for formal concept analysis (FCA). Our investigation contributes totwo distinct lines of research. First, we enable the application of FCA notionsto large data sets. In particular, we demonstrate how the cover relation of aconcept lattice can be retrieved from a computational feasible embedding.Secondly, we show an enhancement for the classical node2vec approach in lowdimension. For both directions the overall constraint of FCA of explainableresults is preserved. We evaluate our novel procedures by computing fca2vec ondifferent data sets like, wiki44 (a dense part of the Wikidata knowledgegraph), the Mushroom data set and a publication network derived from the FCAcommunity.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11496
Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion,2019-11-26,"Knowledge graphs (KGs) serve as useful resources for various natural languageprocessing applications. Previous KG completion approaches require a largenumber of training instances (i.e., head-tail entity pairs) for every relation.The real case is that for most of the relations, very few entity pairs areavailable. Existing work of one-shot learning limits method generalizabilityfor few-shot scenarios and does not fully use the supervisory information;however, few-shot KG completion has not been well studied yet. In this work, wepropose a novel few-shot relation learning model (FSRL) that aims atdiscovering facts of new relations with few-shot references. FSRL caneffectively capture knowledge from heterogeneous graph structure, aggregaterepresentations of few-shot references, and match similar entity pairs ofreference set for every relation. Extensive experiments on two public datasetsdemonstrate that FSRL outperforms the state-of-the-art.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11298
AttKGCN: Attribute Knowledge Graph Convolutional Network for Person Re-identification,2019-11-24,"Discriminative feature representation of person image is important for personre-identification (Re-ID) task. Recently, attributes have been demonstratedbeneficially in guiding for learning more discriminative featurerepresentations for Re-ID. As attributes normally co-occur in person images, itis desirable to model the attribute dependencies to improve the attributeprediction and thus Re-ID results. In this paper, we propose to model theseattribute dependencies via a novel attribute knowledge graph (AttKG), andpropose a novel Attribute Knowledge Graph Convolutional Network (AttKGCN) tosolve Re-ID problem. AttKGCN integrates both attribute prediction and Re-IDlearning together in a unified end-to-end framework which can boost theirperformances, respectively. AttKGCN first builds a directed attribute KG whosenodes denote attributes and edges encode the co-occurrence relationships ofdifferent attributes. Then, AttKGCN learns a set of inter-dependent attributeclassifiers which are combined with person visual descriptors for attributeprediction. Finally, AttKGCN integrates attribute description and deeply visualrepresentation together to construct a more discriminative featurerepresentation for Re-ID task. Extensive experiments on several benchmarkdatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AttKGCN on attribute prediction andRe-ID tasks.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10544
Knowledge Graph Transfer Network for Few-Shot Recognition,2019-11-21,"Few-shot learning aims to learn novel categories from very few samples givensome base categories with sufficient training samples. The main challenge ofthis task is the novel categories are prone to dominated by color, texture,shape of the object or background context (namely specificity), which aredistinct for the given few training samples but not common for thecorresponding categories (see Figure 1). Fortunately, we find that transferringinformation of the correlated based categories can help learn the novelconcepts and thus avoid the novel concept being dominated by the specificity.Besides, incorporating semantic correlations among different categories caneffectively regularize this information transfer. In this work, we representthe semantic correlations in the form of structured knowledge graph andintegrate this graph into deep neural networks to promote few-shot learning bya novel Knowledge Graph Transfer Network (KGTN). Specifically, by initializingeach node with the classifier weight of the corresponding category, apropagation mechanism is learned to adaptively propagate node message throughthe graph to explore node interaction and transfer classifier information ofthe base categories to those of the novel ones. Extensive experiments on theImageNet dataset show significant performance improvement compared with currentleading competitors. Furthermore, we construct an ImageNet-6K dataset thatcovers larger scale categories, i.e, 6,000 categories, and experiments on thisdataset further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09579
Customized Graph Embedding: Tailoring the Embedding Vector to a Specific Application,2019-11-21,"The graph is a natural representation of data in a variety of real-worldapplications, for example as a knowledge graph, a social network, or abiological network. To better leverage the information behind the data, themethod of graph embedding is recently proposed and extensively studied. Thetraditional graph embedding method, while it provides an effective way tounderstand what is behind the graph data, is unfortunately sub-optimal in manycases. This is because its learning procedure is disconnected from the targetapplication. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Customized GraphEmbedding (CGE), to tackle this problem. The CGE algorithm learns a customizedvector representation of the graph by differentiating the varying importance ofdistinct graph paths. Experiments are carried out on a diverse set of nodeclassification datasets and strong performance is demonstrated.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09454
Learning Hierarchy-Aware Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Link Prediction,2019-11-21,"Knowledge graph embedding, which aims to represent entities and relations aslow dimensional vectors (or matrices, tensors, etc.), has been shown to be apowerful technique for predicting missing links in knowledge graphs. Existingknowledge graph embedding models mainly focus on modeling relation patternssuch as symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and composition. However, manyexisting approaches fail to model semantic hierarchies, which are common inreal-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novelknowledge graph embedding model---namely, Hierarchy-Aware Knowledge GraphEmbedding (HAKE)---which maps entities into the polar coordinate system. HAKEis inspired by the fact that concentric circles in the polar coordinate systemcan naturally reflect the hierarchy. Specifically, the radial coordinate aimsto model entities at different levels of the hierarchy, and entities withsmaller radii are expected to be at higher levels; the angular coordinate aimsto distinguish entities at the same level of the hierarchy, and these entitiesare expected to have roughly the same radii but different angles. Experimentsdemonstrate that HAKE can effectively model the semantic hierarchies inknowledge graphs, and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-artmethods on benchmark datasets for the link prediction task.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09419
Knowledge Graph Alignment Network with Gated Multi-hop Neighborhood Aggregation,2019-11-20,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm forembedding-based entity alignment due to their capability of identifyingisomorphic subgraphs. However, in real knowledge graphs (KGs), the counterpartentities usually have non-isomorphic neighborhood structures, which easilycauses GNNs to yield different representations for them. To tackle thisproblem, we propose a new KG alignment network, namely AliNet, aiming atmitigating the non-isomorphism of neighborhood structures in an end-to-endmanner. As the direct neighbors of counterpart entities are usually dissimilardue to the schema heterogeneity, AliNet introduces distant neighbors to expandthe overlap between their neighborhood structures. It employs an attentionmechanism to highlight helpful distant neighbors and reduce noises. Then, itcontrols the aggregation of both direct and distant neighborhood informationusing a gating mechanism. We further propose a relation loss to refine entityrepresentations. We perform thorough experiments with detailed ablation studiesand analyses on five entity alignment datasets, demonstrating the effectivenessof AliNet.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08936
Rule-Guided Compositional Representation Learning on Knowledge Graphs,2019-11-20,"Representation learning on a knowledge graph (KG) is to embed entities andrelations of a KG into low-dimensional continuous vector spaces. Early KGembedding methods only pay attention to structured information encoded intriples, which would cause limited performance due to the structure sparsenessof KGs. Some recent attempts consider paths information to expand the structureof KGs but lack explainability in the process of obtaining the pathrepresentations. In this paper, we propose a novel Rule and Path-based JointEmbedding (RPJE) scheme, which takes full advantage of the explainability andaccuracy of logic rules, the generalization of KG embedding as well as thesupplementary semantic structure of paths. Specifically, logic rules ofdifferent lengths (the number of relations in rule body) in the form of Hornclauses are first mined from the KG and elaborately encoded for representationlearning. Then, the rules of length 2 are applied to compose paths accuratelywhile the rules of length 1 are explicitly employed to create semanticassociations among relations and constrain relation embeddings. Besides, theconfidence level of each rule is also considered in optimization to guaranteethe availability of applying the rule to representation learning. Extensiveexperimental results illustrate that RPJE outperforms other state-of-the-artbaselines on KG completion task, which also demonstrate the superiority ofutilizing logic rules as well as paths for improving the accuracy andexplainability of representation learning.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08935
Joint Embedding Learning of Educational Knowledge Graphs,2019-11-20,"n efficient model for knowledge organization, the knowledge graph hasbeen widely adopted in several fields, e.g., biomedicine, sociology, andeducation. And there is a steady trend of learning embedding representations ofknowledge graphs to facilitate knowledge graph construction and downstreamtasks. In general, knowledge graph embedding techniques aim to learn vectorizedrepresentations which preserve the structural information of the graph. Andconventional embedding learning models rely on structural relationships amongentities and relations. However, in educational knowledge graphs, structuralrelationships are not the focus. Instead, rich literals of the graphs are morevaluable. In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose a novel model forembedding learning of educational knowledge graphs. Our model considers bothstructural and literal information and jointly learns embeddingrepresentations. Three experimental graphs were constructed based on aneducational knowledge graph which has been applied in real-world teaching. Weconducted two experiments on the three graphs and other common benchmarkgraphs. The experimental results proved the effectiveness of our model and itssuperiority over other baselines when processing educational knowledge graphs.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08776
Knowledge Graph Entity Alignment with Graph Convolutional Networks: Lessons Learned,2019-11-19,"In this work, we focus on the problem of entity alignment in Knowledge Graphs(KG) and we report on our experiences when applying a Graph ConvolutionalNetwork (GCN) based model for this task. Variants of GCN are used in multiplestate-of-the-art approaches and therefore it is important to understand thespecifics and limitations of GCN-based models. Despite serious efforts, we werenot able to fully reproduce the results from the original paper and after athorough audit of the code provided by authors, we concluded, that theirimplementation is different from the architecture described in the paper. Inaddition, several tricks are required to make the model work and some of themare not very intuitive. We provide an extensive ablation study to quantify theeffects these tricks and changes of architecture have on final performance.Furthermore, we examine current evaluation approaches and systematize availablebenchmark datasets. We believe that people interested in KG matching mightprofit from our work, as well as novices entering the field",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08342
mporal Knowledge Graph Embedding Model based on Additive Time Series Decomposition,2019-11-18,"Knowledge Graph (KG) embedding has attracted more attention in recent years.Most of KG embedding models learn from time-unaware triples. However, theinclusion of temporal information beside triples would further improve theperformance of a KGE model. In this regard, we propose ATiSE, a temporal KGembedding model which incorporates time information into entity/relationrepresentations by using Additive Time Series decomposition. Moreover,considering the temporal uncertainty during the evolution of entity/relationrepresentations over time, we map the representations of temporal KGs into thespace of multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions. The mean of eachentity/relation embedding at a time step shows the current expected position,whereas its covariance (which is temporally stationary) represents its temporaluncertainty. Experimental results show that ATiSE not only achieves thestate-of-the-art on link prediction over temporal KGs, but also can predict theoccurrence time of facts with missing time annotations, as well as theexistence of future events. To the best of our knowledge, no other model iscapable to perform all these tasks.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07893
Beyond the Grounding Bottleneck: Datalog Techniques for Inference in Probabilistic Logic Programs (Technical Report),2019-11-18,"State-of-the-art inference approaches in probabilistic logic programmingtypically start by computing the relevant ground program with respect to thequeries of interest, and then use this program for probabilistic inferenceusing knowledge compilation and weighted model counting. We propose analternative approach that uses efficient Datalog techniques to integrateknowledge compilation with forward reasoning with a non-ground program. Thiseffectively eliminates the grounding bottleneck that so far has prohibited theapplication of probabilistic logic programming in query answering scenariosover knowledge graphs, while also providing fast approximations on classicalbenchmarks in the field.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07750
Using Mapping Languages for Building Legal Knowledge Graphs from XML Files,2019-11-18,"This paper presents our experience on building RDF knowledge graphs for anindustrial use case in the legal domain. The information contained in legalinformation systems are often accessed through simple keyword interfaces andpresented as a simple list of hits. In order to improve search accuracy one mayavail of knowledge graphs, where the semantics of the data can be madeexplicit. Significant research effort has been invested in the area of buildingknowledge graphs from semi-structured text documents, such as XML, with theprevailing approach being the use of mapping languages. In this paper, wepresent a semantic model for representing legal documents together with anindustrial use case. We also present a set of use case requirements based onthe proposed semantic model, which are used to compare and discuss the use ofstate-of-the-art mapping languages for building knowledge graphs for legaldata.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07673
Pattern-based design applied to cultural heritage knowledge graphs,2019-11-18,"Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) have become an established and recognisedpractice for guaranteeing good quality ontology engineering. There are severalODP repositories where ODPs are shared as well as ontology design methodologiesrecommending their reuse. Performing rigorous testing is recommended as wellfor supporting ontology maintenance and validating the resulting resourceagainst its motivating requirements. Nevertheless, it is less thanstraightforward to find guidelines on how to apply such methodologies fordeveloping domain-specific knowledge graphs. ArCo is the knowledge graph ofItalian Cultural Heritage and has been developed by using eXtreme Design (XD),an ODP- and test-driven methodology. During its development, XD has beenadapted to the need of the CH domain e.g. gathering requirements from an open,diverse community of consumers, a new ODP has been defined and many have beenspecialised to address specific CH requirements. This paper presents ArCo anddescribes how to apply XD to the development and validation of a CH knowledgegraph, also detailing the (intellectual) process implemented for matching theencountered modelling problems to ODPs. Relevant contributions also include anovel web tool for supporting unit-testing of knowledge graphs, a rigorousevaluation of ArCo, and a discussion of methodological lessons learned duringArCo development.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07585
Neural Recurrent Structure Search for Knowledge Graph Embedding,2019-11-17,"Knowledge graph (KG) embedding is a fundamental problem in mining relationalpatterns. It aims to encode the entities and relations in KG into lowdimensional vector space that can be used for subsequent algorithms. Lots of KGembedding models have been proposed to learn the interactions between entitiesand relations, which contain meaningful semantic information. However,structural information, which encodes local topology among entities, is alsoimportant to KG. In this work, we propose S2E to distill structural informationand combine it with semantic information for different KGs as a neuralarchitecture search (NAS) problem. First, we analyze the difficulty of using aunified model to solve the distillation problem. Based on it, we define thepath distiller to recurrently combine structural and semantic information alongrelational paths, which are sampled to preserve both local topologies andsemantics. Then, inspired by the recent success of NAS, we design a recurrentnetwork-based search space for specific KG tasks and propose a natural gradient(NG) based search algorithm to update architectures. Experimental resultsdemonstrate that the searched models by our proposed S2E outperformhuman-designed ones, and the NG based search algorithm is efficient comparedwith other NAS methods. Besides, our work is the first NAS method for RNN thatcan search architectures with better performance than human-designed models.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07132
Inductive Relation Prediction on Knowledge Graphs,2019-11-16,"Inferring missing edges in multi-relational knowledge graphs is a fundamentaltask in statistical relational learning. However, previous work has largelyfocused on the transductive relation prediction problem, where missing edgesmust be predicted for a single, fixed graph. In contrast, many real-worldsituations require relation prediction on dynamic or previously unseenknowledge graphs (e.g., for question answering, dialogue, or e-commerceapplications). Here, we develop a novel graph neural network (GNN) architectureto perform inductive relation prediction and provide a systematic comparisonbetween this GNN approach and a strong, rule-based baseline. Our resultshighlight the significant difficulty of inductive relational learning, comparedto the transductive case, and offer a new challenging set of inductivebenchmarks for knowledge graph completion.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06962
CNN-based Dual-Chain Models for Knowledge Graph Learning,2019-11-15,"Knowledge graph learning plays a critical role in integrating domain specificknowledge bases when deploying machine learning and data mining models inpractice. Existing methods on knowledge graph learning primarily focus onmodeling the relations among entities as translations among the relations andentities, and many of these methods are not able to handle zero-shot problems,when new entities emerge. In this paper, we present a new convolutional neuralnetwork (CNN)-based dual-chain model. Different from translation based methods,in our model, interactions among relations and entities are directly capturedvia CNN over their embeddings. Moreover, a secondary chain of learning isconducted simultaneously to incorporate additional information and to enablebetter performance. We also present an extension of this model, whichincorporates descriptions of entities and learns a second set of entityembeddings from the descriptions. As a result, the extended model is able toeffectively handle zero-shot problems. We conducted comprehensive experiments,comparing our methods with 15 methods on 8 benchmark datasets. Extensiveexperimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve oroutperform the state-of-the-art results on knowledge graph learning, andoutperform other methods on zero-shot problems. In addition, our methodsapplied to real-world biomedical data are able to produce results that conformto expert domain knowledge.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06910
Data Preparation in Agriculture Through Automated Semantic Annotation -- Basis for a Wide Range of Smart Services,2019-11-15,"Modern agricultural technology and the increasing digitalisation of suchprocesses provide a wide range of data. However, their efficient and beneficialuse suffers from legitimate concerns about data sovereignty and control, formatinconsistencies and different interpretations. As a proposed solution, wepresent Wikinormia, a collaborative platform in which interested participantscan describe and discuss their own new data formats. Once a finalizedvocabulary has been created, specific parsers can semantically process the rawdata into three basic representations: spatial information, time series andsemantic facts (agricultural knowledge graph). Thanks to publicly accessibledefinitions and descriptions, developers can easily gain an overview of theconcepts that are relevant to them. A variety of services will then (subject toindividual access rights) be able to query their data simply via a queryinterface and retrieve results.

Multi-domain Dialogue State Tracking as Dynamic Knowledge Graph Enhanced Question Answering,2019-11-07,"Multi-domain dialogue state tracking (DST) is a critical component forconversational AI systems. The domain ontology (i.e., specification of domains,slots, and values) of a conversational AI system is generally incomplete,making the capability for DST models to generalize to new slots, values, anddomains during inference imperative. In this paper, we propose to modelmulti-domain DST as a question answering problem, referred to as Dialogue StateTracking via Question Answering (DSTQA). Within DSTQA, each turn generates aquestion asking for the value of a (domain, slot) pair, thus making itnaturally extensible to unseen domains, slots, and values. Additionally, we usea dynamically-evolving knowledge graph to explicitly learn relationshipsbetween (domain, slot) pairs. Our model has a 5.80% and 12.21% relativeimprovement over the current state-of-the-art model on MultiWOZ 2.0 andMultiWOZ 2.1 datasets, respectively. Additionally, our model consistentlyoutperforms the state-of-the-art model in domain adaptation settings.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06192
KEPLER: A Unified Model for Knowledge Embedding and Pre-trained Language Representation,2019-11-13,"Pre-trained language representation models (PLMs) learn effective languagerepresentations from large-scale unlabeled corpora. Knowledge embedding (KE)algorithms encode the entities and relations in knowledge graphs intoinformative embeddings to do knowledge graph completion and provide externalknowledge for various NLP applications. In this paper, we propose a unifiedmodel for Knowledge Embedding and Pre-trained LanguagE Representation (KEPLER),which not only better integrates factual knowledge into PLMs but alsoeffectively learns knowledge graph embeddings. Our KEPLER utilizes a PLM toencode textual descriptions of entities as their entity embeddings, and thenjointly learn the knowledge embeddings and language representations.Experimental results on various NLP tasks such as the relation extraction andthe entity typing show that our KEPLER can achieve comparable results to thestate-of-the-art knowledge-enhanced PLMs without any additional inferenceoverhead. Furthermore, we construct Wikidata5m, a new large-scale knowledgegraph dataset with aligned text descriptions, to evaluate KE embedding methodsin both the traditional transductive setting and the challenging inductivesetting, which needs the models to predict entity embeddings for unseenentities. Experiments demonstrate our KEPLER can achieve good results in bothsettings.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06136
